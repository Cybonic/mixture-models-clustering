# To-DO
Build the base framework, essential features: 
    
    - [] Tensorboard
    - [] Save and load pretrained models
    - [] Save training config 
 

What does Likelihood means, in the GMM context?

# LOG
[01/03/2022] Changed the purpose of this repository; the new goal is to explore classical segmentation approaches

[01/02/2022] #GENERIC #TENSORBOARD Added new tensorboard feature, namely to visualize images and their prediction;

[31/01/2022] #GENERIC #TENSORBOARD Added a more generic architecture, namely using base modules. Also started to add tensorboard features;
